# you might have some questions about the css

Hello, and welcome to this little site if this is your first time here!
Its probably your last time here given how "colourful" the css is.

Hot pink is an eye searingly bright colour -
Lime green can also do that.

Combine the two contrasting colours -
and you have head ache level enducing levels of brightness 

I love how linus tech tips has a hot pink server rack -
so why cant i have a hot pink website :3 .


Thats my reasoning.
Nothing else.


Have a good one,
- :3
